What is the perfect ratio for a flag?

For some of us the proportions of a flag is not something we might not normally think about when looking at a flag 
However there are some very different standards:
If by perfect you mean standard you can easily ask [Wikipedia][wikipedia] such that the following numbers turn up:


However is the sqrt(2) something else, namely that it allows scaling without compromising the aspect ratio

It turns out that the proportions of flag is linked to their history. In general British flags have a **1:2** ratio, French flags have a **2:3** ratio and German flags have a **3:5** ratio.

I a similar fashion one could ask why computer screen have aspect ratio 4:3, 16:9 or 16:10 or why
